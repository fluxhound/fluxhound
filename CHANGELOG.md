# Changelog

## 2026-07-11 (2)
- Replace the static `local_config.py` with a GUI-driven device config:
  first start asks for device ID/IP/local key if none is registered
  yet, "Change device" button to re-enter them, values persisted to
  gitignored `device_config.json` next to the app.
- Power switch now reflects the bulb's actual on/off state on connect
  instead of always starting deselected.
- README: added a short, honest note that the project is built with
  AI pair-programming assistance.

## 2026-07-11
- Phase 2 GUI: brightness slider and colour-palette swatches wired live
  to the bulb (no apply button), debounced slider input, power toggle.
- `TuyaBulb` hardened: socket timeout, retry on transient failures, and
  `TuyaConnectionError` for unreachable/misbehaving devices; GUI calls
  now run off the Tk main thread and show connection errors instead of
  crashing.
- Fix README venv activation command for PowerShell (`Activate.ps1`
  instead of the extensionless `activate`, which PowerShell won't
  resolve) — cause of a `ModuleNotFoundError: customtkinter` when
  running `python -m src.main` outside the venv.

## 2026-07-10
- Initial project skeleton: folder structure, `TuyaBulb` wrapper around
  tinytuya (DP schema for the Meka A60-RGBCW model), minimal
  customtkinter GUI with on/off control, licensing stub, and a
  `local_config.py` template for test device credentials.
